== Installation ==
You probably know the drill by now, but if not, here's a step by step suggestion.

1. Upload the `SwiftCloud` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. To install a webform, login at <a href="https://SwiftCRM.Com?pr=92" target="_new">https://SwiftCRM.Com</a> (free signup) and click 'new form',
drag and drop fields to create a form, click save, and then remember the number it gives you.
4. Either drop a shortcode like [swiftform id="123"] (change the 123 to your form number)
5. OR go to appearance >> widgets and drag 'SwiftForm' over into a widget location.

For the various popups, just see the settings area. Note the popup contents get created on <a href="https://SwiftCRM.Com?pr=92" target="_new">https://SwiftCRM.Com</a>, then embedded via the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. How do I use it?

Easy!

* First, signup at [SwiftCloud](https://SwiftCRM.Com) (free), then when logged in, hover the logo top left and drop it to SwiftForm.
* Next, go to [SwiftForm >> New Form](https://SwiftCRM.Com/public/create-form?pr=92). Drag and drop from the fields on the left, choose what you want to happen after capture, and hit save.
* Next, embed into your website by dropping in a shortcode like [swiftform id="123"] (change the 123 to your form number) OR go to appearance >> widgets and drag 'SwiftForm' over into a widget location.

That's it.
